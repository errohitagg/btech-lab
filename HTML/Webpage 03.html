<h2>The original intent of HTML was to markup text to indicate the purpose of each part of the document.
Logical Tags, also called Idiomatic Elements indicate different types of information. Logical tags have 
lost favor to "formatting tags", which indicate the physical appearance of the document. This loss of 
popularity is unfortunate, because logical tags still serve some important purposes :</h2><br>
<h3>1. Logical tags allow the browser to render that information in the manner most appropriate for that 
browser. Text should be emphasized may be best emphasized in Windows with italics, and bold in Unix.<br>
2. Logical tags help the author keep track of what a person is saying, without distraction of presentation.
